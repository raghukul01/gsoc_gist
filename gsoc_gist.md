### Organization: [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/)
Hi, my name is [Raghukul Raman](https://raghukul01.github.io/) and I have been working on implementing rational 
point algorithms for Schemes, in Google Summer of Code 2018. 
This gist describes all the work that I have done during this period.

### Trac Tickets
SageMath uses the [Trac](trac.sagemath.org) issue tracking system for development, 
each ticket has a unique ticket number. These ticket contain all the important discussion 
regarding that issue, it also contain links to the commit. Apart from coding, I also reviewed 
some ticket of other sage developers.
For convenience I have provides
link to my commits in the end, also current status of each ticket (including reviewed tickets).

<br />
Now lets discuss each of the Ticket which I have worked on:
